# ============================================
# ðŸ“š Concept: Aggregation
# ============================================
# Aggregation is a type of relationship between objects where one object contains 
# a reference to another object, but the referenced object can exist independently.
# This is a "has-a" relationship, but in contrast to composition, 
# the contained objects do not necessarily depend on the life cycle of the parent object.
# In aggregation, the child object (in this case, the Employee) can exist outside the context 
# of the parent object (the Department).
